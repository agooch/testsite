# User Permissions Policy

Effective November 1st, 2022, UNC Dataverse has changed its user policy to permit only UNC faculty, students, staff, and 
approved affiliates the ability to create new sub-dataverses and share data within UNC Dataverse. 
This change is to promote UNC-based research initiatives and ensure a more secure user experience for the 
research community. 
<p></p>
With this change, we have implemented new user permissions as described below:
<p></p>
<strong>UNC Shibboleth</strong>: A faculty, student, or staff member of UNC Chapel Hill that logs in with their onyen. 
UNC Shibboleth users have permissions to create new dataverses within UNC Dataverse and share their data 
within those dataverses.
<p></p>
<strong>Non-UNC Shibboleth</strong>: An affiliate who logs into UNC Dataverse using their institution’s Shibboleth single 
sign-on. Non-UNC Shibboleth users may contribute to pre-existing dataverses they are Admins of or may request 
access to contribute to someone else’s dataverse. To request access to share data within an existing dataverse, 
please click on the Contact link of that dataverse and request permissions from the dataverse Admin.
<p></p>
<strong>Local</strong>: A user who logs into UNC Dataverse using a Dataverse-specific username and password. If you had a 
local account before November 1st, you are still able to access any dataverses and datasets you own. You may 
continue to add datasets to your pre-existing dataverse(s). If your institution does not use Shibboleth single 
sign-on and you need to contribute to a UNC researcher’s dataverse, you may request a local account be created 
via this (link).
<p></p>
<strong>Oauth</strong>: A user who logged in via Gmail or Github. This feature has been disabled. Any user who logged in 
via Gmail or Github will need to convert their account to a Shibboleth account or may <a href="https://agooch.github.io/testsite/docs/gettingstarted/createaccount.html" target="_blank">request a local account</a> 
if they require access to a pre-existing dataverse. The Odum Institute Data Archive will consider all requests 
and reserves the right to deny any request deemed outside of the scope of our current 
<a href="https://odum.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1060/2022/11/Policy_UNCDataverseTermsofUse_20221101.pdf" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>.
<p></p> 
Please see our <a href="https://agooch.github.io/testsite/faqs.html" target="_blank">FAQs</a> if you have questions 
about User Accounts and Permissions.
