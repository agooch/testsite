# Create a Dataverse

If you would like to view a step-by-step walkthrough of creating and customizing a project dataverse, please see our tutorial here.  
<p></p>
To share your research, you must first create a project dataverse within UNC Dataverse. After logging into UNC Dataverse, scroll down to the ‘Add Data’ button on the main page. Select ‘New Dataverse’. 
<p></p>

<p></p>
You will be taken to the New Dataverse page. UNC Dataverse requires the following information to create a new dataverse:
<p></p> 
<ul>
  <li>Dataverse Name:</li> 
  <li>Identifier: (the shortname used for the URL of the dataverse)</li>
  <li>Category:</li> 
  <li>Email:</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
A description of the dataverse can also be provided on this page. This will help users better understand the contents and purpose of your dataverse. 
<p></p>

<p></p>
Once you have filled in this information, scroll down to the Metadata Fields section. Here you can decide which metadata fields will be available to you when creating a dataset within your dataverse. You may choose the default ‘Use metadata fields from UNC Dataverse’ or select one or more of the metadata option(s) listed. If you are uncertain which metadata option is appropriate for your dataverse, you can click ‘[+] View Fields’ to see what each metadata option includes. 
<p></p>

<p></p>
Beneath the Metadata Fields section is the Browse/Search Facets section. As the administrator of your project dataverse, you can determine which facets appear on the left side of your dataverse. These facets are available to users to refine the results list and can aid them in locating the most relevant datasets, dataverses, or files within your project dataverse.
<p></p>
The ’Use browse/search facets from UNC Dataverse’ is enabled by default, but you may deselect this option and instead choose from the list of facets underneath.
<p></p>
To remove an already selected facet, click on the facet under the ‘Selected’ list and then select the <- to remove it from the ‘Selected’ list.
<p></p>

<p></p>
To add a facet, select the desired facet(s) in the list on the left and then click the -> to move it to the ‘Selected’ list. The selected facets will now show up on the left side of your dataverse.
<p></p>

<p></p>
Once you have added all the necessary information and selected your metadata and facet customizations, click on ‘Create Dataverse’. Congratulations! You’ve successfully created your first dataverse within UNC Dataverse.
<p></p>
You may further customize your project dataverse by selecting ‘Edit’ and choosing from the dropdown menu. Additional customizations include setting permissions levels, assigning roles to other users or groups, adding design elements such as logos and project links, developing dataset templates, and creating guestbooks to track user metrics.

## General Information

This page should look familiar to users who just created their project dataverse. The general information page is where dataverse admins may update the description of their dataverse, the contact information, and make changes to the metadata and facet selections that will display on their dataverse page. Dataverse admins may return to this page at any time to make updates as needed. 

## Themes & Widgets

Admin may customize the look of their project dataverse using the Themes & Widgets interface. 
<p></p>
From the Themes tab, users may upload a logo for their project dataverse, choose a different background color, link color, and text color for the header, include a tagline and URL to a project website, and add a footer image. This helps brand the project dataverse and differentiate it from the UNC Dataverse.

<p></p>
The Widgets tab provides HTML code that you can embed within your project website. You may select the Dataverse Search Box HTML code to generate an embedded search box in your website that links back to results in your project dataverse, or you may select the Dataverse Listing HTML code which embeds your project dataverse results list within your website. This is another useful mechanism for branding your project dataverse and making it more accessible to users exploring your project website.
