# Exploring Dataverse

## Searching Dataverse

Searching UNC Dataverse is relatively straightforward. Users may use either the search bar located above the Results list on the main page, or they can explore dataverse using the facets on the left side of the main page.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Basic Search</strong></summary><br>

  <p></p>
  UNC Dataverse offers a search bar to help users locate data or research projects of interest. The bar is just above the Results list and functions like a typical search bar. Simply enter the keywords describing the type(s) of data you are looking for and click ‘Find’. 
</details>
<p></p>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Advanced Search</strong></summary><br>
  If the basic search bar is not providing specific search results, we recommend using the advanced search to narrow the list down. The advanced search allows users to search across individual metadata fields for relevant results at the Dataverse, Dataset, and File-level. 
  <p></p>
  To get started, click ‘Advanced Search’ beside the search bar on the main UNC Dataverse landing page. You will be redirected to a new search page.
  <p></p>

  <p></p>
  From here you can decide to search across Dataverse, Datasets, or individual Files. Simply scroll to the section you wish to search through and then identify the field(s) you want to enter keywords into. 
  <p></p>

  <p></p>
  Once you’ve entered as many keywords as needed, click ‘Find’. Your results will load in a new UNC Dataverse page. 
  <p></p>
  If your search provides 0 results, we recommend removing a keyword or checking your spelling for any typos.

## Browsing Dataverse

<details>
  <summary><strong>Dataverse vs. Dataset</strong></summary><br>
  A dataverse is a collection that can hold datasets as well as other dataverse collections. You can think of it as a container as depicted below.
  <p></p>

  <p></p>
  This permits users to organize their research in various ways.
  <p></p>
  You can search at the Dataverse level or filter down to the Dataset or File level by using the checkbox options on the far left of the UNC Dataverse page.

</details>
<p></p>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Facets</strong></summary><br>
  Facets are specific terms used to narrow down the results in the UNC Dataverse results list. You can find them on the far left of both the UNC Dataverse main page, but also within dataverses housed under UNC Dataverse. Clicking on a facet will only show those results related to the selected facet.
  <p></p>
  To remove the facet from your search, navigate to the top of the results list and click the ‘x’ beside the facet label.

<p></p>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Results List</strong></summary><br>
  The results list is in the middle of the UNC Dataverse main page. This list will update every time you perform a search or select a facet. You can sort the list by clicking on the Sort button to the right.
  <p></p>
  <img src="https://agooch.github.io/testsite/assets/images/sortresults.png">
  <p></p>
  You will only see published Dataverses, Datasets, and Files in the results list. If you are the Admin, Curator, or Contributor of an unpublished draft Dataverse or Dataset, you may also see them in the results list.
