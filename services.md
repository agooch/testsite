# UNC Dataverse Support Services

If you would prefer the guidance of Odum Institute Data Archive staff to help ensure compliance with archival standards and best practices, we offer researchers the option of selecting appropriate services to meet their research project needs. These services are available to address specific areas of a data management workflow pertaining to the curation and archiving of your data. Services include:

**Documentation Review**\
Odum Archive staff will review all available documentation for completeness and understandability. We will offer recommendations for improvement as needed. Once the documentation is complete, we will create a preservation version of the documentation to be included in the final dataset record in UNC Dataverse (or your repository of choice).

**Data Review**\
Our staff will review the data file(s) for any sensitive information such as protected health information or personally identifiable information. All data being shared in the UNC Dataverse must be free from any sensitive or potentially identifying information. We will make recommendations for cleaning your data before submitting it to a repository for public sharing.

**UNC Dataverse Branding & Metadata Template Creation**\
We are available to customize your UNC Dataverse to include logos, website links, descriptions, permissions, and group access. In addition, we will develop custom metadata templates to make dataset creation easier on your project team.

**Custom Upload, Review, and Publishing Guidance**\
For larger teams, we can create custom guidance documents that will walk team members through the entire upload and publish workflow for your dataverse. Custom documentation includes step-by-step visuals, definitions and explanations of processes, as well as contact information for relevant project managers and dataverse administrators.

**Full UNC Dataverse Support**\
For those researchers who would prefer the Odum Institute Data Archive manage all aspects of their data management and sharing workflows, including data and documentation review, dataverse and dataset creation, file normalization, ingest, and permissions, please provide the following information:

* Description of project
* Funding agency and (if available) data sharing mandate
* Types and file sizes of data
* Are any of these data sensitive or do they contain personally identifiable information or protected health information?
* List of project team members
* Timeline for completion

In order to schedule a consultation and receive a quote, please contact [odumarchive@unc.edu](mailto:odumarchive@unc.edu) with a description of which service(s) you are interested in.
