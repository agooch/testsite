  <summary><strong>Why should I deposit my research data in UNC Dataverse?</strong></summary><br>
  
   Sharing and preserving research data is an important part of the research lifecycle. By depositing your data in a data repository like UNC Dataverse, you are ensuring that your research is accessible and reusable well into the future. Not only is this beneficial for your own research needs, but it permits others to build upon your work to advance scientific inquiry and discovery. 
  <p></p>
   The U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy has released various memos (<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf" target="_blank">2013</a>, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf" target="_blank">2022</a>) charging federal funding agencies with developing and honing their <a href="https://odum.unc.edu/archive/#archive3" target="_blank">data management and sharing policies</a> for all funded research. In order to comply with these policies, researchers must share the outputs of their research with the public in appropriate data repositories.
  <p></p>
   In addition to government mandates, research communities are quickly adopting the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR Principles</a> for making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.  These principles offer guidance for ensuring that data are properly preserved, described, and shared for future access and reuse. UNC Dataverse is FAIR compliant.  

</details>
<p></p>
<details>
  <summary><strong>What is the difference between putting my data in UNC Dataverse vs. other cloud storage options such as Dropbox or OneDrive?</strong></summary><br>
  
   While Dropbox and OneDrive may be approved and viable options for storing data during the active phase of your research, they are not long-term preservation and access platforms. Additionally, they do not support <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR Principles</a> for making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. 
  <p></p>
  Using an established and trusted data repository like UNC Dataverse to share and archive your data ensures your research outputs and hard work are well described and findable now and into the future. 
  <p></p>
  Through UNC Dataverse, users can understand the context and licensing of your data thanks to the machine-readable metadata and customizable terms of use provided by a data repository. UNC Dataverse is built on recognized preservation technology that performs checks and audits on files and is backed up regularly to multiple servers across the country, meaning your data are safe from corruption and loss. The Odum Institute staff are also fully committed to the long-term preservation of research data and have developed <a href="https://odum.unc.edu/archive/#archive1" target="_blank">policies</a> around data archiving and security best practices and standards.

## Account

<details>
  <summary><strong>I am not affiliated with UNC.  Can I still use UNC Dataverse to share my data?</strong></summary><br>
  
   The UNC Dataverse user policy has recently been updated to limit data sharing within UNC Dataverse to UNC faculty, students, and staff. However, we recognize that UNC researchers often partner with external collaborators on projects; therefore, external collaborators are permitted to share data within a UNC research project dataverse. 
  <p></p>
If you are not affiliated with UNC and are not an external collaborator, you will not be able to create any new dataverses or share data within UNC Dataverse. We recommend exploring <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Harvard Dataverse</a> as an open data repository option.

</details>
<p></p>
<details>
  <summary><strong>I am an external collaborator/co-PI/partner on a UNC-based research initiative that is using UNC Dataverse to share data. How do I request permission to contribute to a UNC research project dataverse? </strong></summary><br>
The first step is to create a UNC Dataverse account. If your institution uses Shibboleth single sign-on as part of the InCommon Federation as a Research and Scholarship entity, you can simply click Login and select your institution from the dropdown menu. If your institution does not use Shibboleth single sign-on, you will need to request a local account be created. Requests for a local account may be submitted here [LINK NEEDS TO BE ADDED HERE]. 
  <p></p>
  Once you have a UNC Dataverse account, you will need to contact the Admin(s) of the UNC research project dataverse you wish to contribute to. The Admin can assign your UNC Dataverse account a role within the Permissions page of the project dataverse.

</details>
<p></p>
<details>
  <summary><strong>I am an Admin for my dataverse and need to add a collaborator as a contributor. How do I grant them permissions within my dataverse? </strong></summary><br>
To grant permissions to a user, navigate to your project dataverse and click Edit. Select Permissions from the dropdown menu. Under Users/Groups, select Assign Roles to Users/Groups. In the pop-up window, enter the user account name and select it from the drop-down. Please note that users must have a Dataverse account to be given permissions. In the same pop-up window, select the role you would like to assign to this user. Clicking on the role will provide a description of the types of actions that role may take. Click Save Changes.

</details> 
<p></p>
<details>
  <summary><strong>If I leave my institution, can I transfer my UNC Dataverse account to my new institutional account?</strong></summary><br>
  
   For account transfers, please contact us using the Support button at the top of UNC Dataverse. Provide your current account email address and username from UNC Dataverse in the body of the message and let us know that you would like to transfer your account to a new institutional login. We will contact you for further information in order to get the transfer completed.  
</details>
<p></p>
<details>
  <summary><strong>The account verification email is missing the verification link. How do I verify my email address?</strong></summary><br>
  
   This is a known bug. We are unable to resolve this issue at the moment; however, users are still able to use UNC Dataverse fully without limitations even if their email address is not verified.  
</details>

<p></p>
<details>
  <summary><strong>What kind of data can I deposit?</strong></summary><br>
  
   UNC Dataverse accepts all types of data; however, it offers optimized preservation for certain file types such as Stata, R, SPSS, and some Excel file types. Dataverse processes these optimized preservation file types during ingest and creates a software agnostic tab-delimited version as well as an RData version of the file for long-term access and preservation. Optimized preservation also permits users the ability to explore these file types within the UNC Dataverse interface. 
  <p></p>
  All other file types are preserved at the bit-level only.
  <p></p>
   While UNC Dataverse can preserve all file types at the bit-level, it may not be the best data repository option for certain data types. If you are uncertain if UNC Dataverse is the best data repository for your research data, please contact <a href="mailto:odumarchive@unc.edu">odumarchive@unc.edu</a> to schedule a free consultation.
